        <p>Indian spiritual art has no equal in the world, either in scope or sheer quantity. For five decades the monks
            at Kauai’s Hindu Monastery in Hawaii have been commissioning and collecting original works of art for our
            many publications, apps and web projects. Among the thousands of images you will find rare masterpieces,
            educational depictions of Hindu culture, legend, deities and philosophy, sacred religious symbols,
            illustrated alphabets, children’s stories and decorative borders. For decades this treasure trove was hidden
            in the binary recesses of our server (even we could barely find things). Now the entire collection is
            available to you through the Himalayan Academy Museum of Spiritual Art. In Sanskrit hamsa is the word for
            the Indian Goose (Anser indicus) or a swan, and represents the Ultimate Reality and the spiritually pure
            soul. The flight of the hamsa symbolizes moksha, the release from the cycle of samsara.</p>
